_Optifly_ delivers flight schedule optimization through a data-driven AI model to low cost carrier (LCC) airlines. As a Senior Frontend Engineer, I work on the client facing UI, which enables _Optifly_'s core users (typically an Airline's Scheduling Team) to harness the capabilities of their key product, Optimiser. I've been primarily involved in development of enhancements to the most trafficed screens and ensuring that the data heavy application has a solid UX and performance. The technology stack is an **Angular 18** frontend with a **Java** API backend.

#### Highlights {#highlights-optifly-senior-frontend}

- Working on a new redesign of the core Schedule Planning feature of the
  main Optifly product, which enhances the current UX, and introduces a new Design System built upon Angular Material.
